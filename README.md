👋 Hi there! 👨‍💻

 - You can call me Dan (He/Him)!
 - I'm an individual looking for a career shift, and all of a sudden I fell in love with Frontend Dev. 
 - I feel there's no turning back at this point - and I'm glad for it!

🌱 I'm doing alright with HTML and CSS, and I'm working my way on JavaScript, so I can keep going and start React!
